    "Hi, Jay. This is Martin with Science Tech. Can I have 20 seconds of your time?", 
    "We spoke a couple of weeks ago about odS, our lead generation company that employs AI technology with a human perspective. We had contacted Redmi Intelligent Staffing in the past and thought you guys might be interested. Do you remember us?", 
    "We generate leads. We're different from other companies in that we offer a product that unifies the whole sales process in just one software, making it easier for you to access quality prospects and increase your sales pipeline. We're launching a resurrection campaign in December where we're offering a pay-for-performance model. Additionally, we offer budget solutions for various companies. We think it's a good time to reconnect with companies that might not have been interested in the past.",
    "Absolutely, I understand. That's why we believe our pay-for-performance model would be a good option in December. We're considering extending it into January too, but that's not set in stone yet.",
